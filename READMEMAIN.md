## Description

Note take app here helps you to write and save notes. It uses Express.js which will help to save and retrive notes data from a local JSON file.

- What was your motivation?
  My main motivation behind creating this project was to make poeple's life easier. We have so many things in our mind and sometimes we get overwhelmed. If we have a note which can be used in a phone, laptop that would help us to make our life a lot easier.

- Why did you build this project?
  (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  Reason behind building this project was to help people from being overwhelmed and por everything that is in their head in a note. This would me us feel less stressed and work in a organized manner.

- What problem does it solve?
  The Note app that I have built solves ample of problems for instance: If you have a list of things or plans for your week and even future, my note app would help you to jot everything down and save them in a local folder. You can also delete if you don't need the note or finished working on that note.

- What did you learn?
  With the help of this project I learned how to work with express and install different npm commands. I was able to get the concept of get, post and delete method and run api local host in a server like Insominia.
